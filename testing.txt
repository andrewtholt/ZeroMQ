To test the full communication pipeline, follow these steps:

1. Open four separate terminal windows.

2. In the first terminal, run the 'subscriber' executable, listening for the final output:
   ./subscriber -u "tcp://localhost:5558" -t OUTPUT

3. In the second terminal, run the 'inputs' executable:
   ./inputs

4. In the third terminal, run the 'controller' executable:
   ./controller

5. In the fourth terminal, run the 'publisher' executable to kick off the process:
   ./publisher -u "tcp://*:5556" -t STATUS -m "START"

After running the final publisher command, you should see a chain reaction:
- The 'inputs' terminal will show it received the 'START' message.
- The 'controller' terminal will show it received the JSON from 'inputs'.
- The 'subscriber' terminal will show the final JSON output from the 'controller'.
